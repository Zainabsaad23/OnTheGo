### Big Idea 
 There are 3 main factors for regulating blood sugar in diabetics 
(healthy food, needles on time, and exercise).Among the most important are the needles on time;
The problem lies in forgetting insulin, and because diabetes is particularly related to the eye and the retina, 
we chose the blind and visually impaired among them. 
Let's make life easier for them and make an alarm for them with a sound to remind them 
of the insulin time and their sugar will be perfect.
